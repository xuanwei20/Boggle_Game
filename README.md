# 🧩 Boggle Game

A Python implementation of the classic **Boggle** word-search game.  
Players form words by connecting adjacent letters on a grid. Words are validated against a dictionary file, and scoring is based on word length.

---

## 📌 Overview

Boggle is played on a grid of letters (commonly 4×4).  
Words must:

- Be at least 3 letters long  
- Be formed from **adjacent letters** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)  
- Not reuse the same letter cell within a single word  
- Exist in the provided dictionary (`words.txt`)

This project searches the board for all valid words and calculates the total score.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 Automatically finds valid words from a Boggle board
- 📄 Uses a dictionary file (`words.txt`) for word validation
- 🧠 Applies official Boggle-style scoring rules
- 🐍 Written in Python (no external dependencies required)
- 📦 MIT Licensed

## 🧮 Scoring Rules

| Word Length | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| 0–2         | 0      |
| 3–4         | 1      |
| 5           | 2      |
| 6           | 3      |
| 7           | 5      |
| 8+          | 11     |

## 📘 How It Works

1. The program generates or reads a Boggle board.
2. It searches all possible adjacent letter combinations.
3. Valid words found in `words.txt` are collected.
4. The final list of words and total score are displayed.
